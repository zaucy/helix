//! `helix-event` contains systems that allow (often async) communication between
//! different editor components without strongly coupling them. Specifically
//! it allows defining synchronous hooks that run when certain editor events
//! occur.
//!
//! The core of the event system are hook callbacks and the [`Event`] trait. A
//! hook is essentially just a closure `Fn(event: &mut impl Event) -> Result<()>`
//! that gets called every time an approriate event is dispatched. The implementation
//! details of the [`Event`] trait are considered private. The [`events`] macro is
//! provided which automatically declares event types. Similarly the `register_hook`
//! macro should be used to (safely) declare event hooks.
//!
//! Hooks run synchronously which can be advantageous since they can modify the
//! current editor state right away (for example to immediately hide the completion
//! popup). However, they can not contain their own state without locking since
//! they only receive immutable references. For handler that want to track state, do
//! expensive background computations or debouncing an [`AsyncHook`] is preferable.
//! Async hooks are based around a channels that receive events specific to
//! that `AsyncHook` (usually an enum). These events can be sent by synchronous
//! hooks. Due to some limtations around tokio channels the [`send_blocking`]
//! function exported in this crate should be used instead of the builtin
//! `blocking_send`.
//!
//! In addition to the core event system, this crate contains some message queues
//! that allow transfer of data back to the main event loop from async hooks and
//! hooks that may not have access to all application data (for example in helix-view).
//! This include the ability to control rendering ([`lock_frame`], [`request_redraw`]) and
//! display status messages ([`status`]).
//!
//! Hooks declared in helix-term can furthermore dispatch synchronous jobs to be run on the
//! main loop (including access to the compositor). Ideally that queue will be moved
//! to helix-view in the future if we manage to detach the compositor from its rendering backend.
